### First off, let's talk about Astro

Astro is awesome! But, why? Once you get to know about it, you'll understand why I started saying that.

Astro is an agnostic-framework that gives you the opportunity to build from static to fullstack web apps.

It lets you to integrate other UI frameworks and libraries, such as React.js, Vue.js, Svelte.js.

It lets you to integrate TailwindCSS, i18n (for translations).

It lets you integrate with a bunch of CMS, and one of them we'll use today: Wordpress.

```

Or you can use npm or yarn, at your taste.
